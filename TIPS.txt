# using nvm to switch node version
nvm use 6.10.3 (up to Composer 0.13)
nvm use v7.10.0 (to use Composer 0.16+)

# check the version of HyperLedger Composer you are running: 
composer -v

# running Composer Playground
You can run playground: http://localhost:8080. You might have to do it from a private browser window 
or call localstorage.clear() in the web browser console to start with a clean cache

# updating the version of Hyperledger Composer

The Hyperledger Composer team is shipping a new version of their product every 2 weeks. Follow this instruction to
upgrade Composer version:

- kill all docker containers
  in fabric-tools, call 'tearDownAllDocker.sh', select option 1

- upgrade composer:
npm install -g composer-cli@0.16.6
npm install -g generator-hyperledger-composer@0.16.6
npm install -g composer-rest-server@0.16.6
npm install -g yo
npm install -g composer-playground@0.16.6

composer -v should give you the version of Composer you've just installed

- start fabric
  in fabric-tools, call 'startFabric.sh'
  call 'createPeerAdminCard.sh' 

- upgrade client
in 'vehicle-lifecycle-cli' update 'package.json' to point to the right version of Composer (0.16.6 for instance)
call 'npm install'

Then you can restart ODM runtime and deployer, deploy the 'vehicle-lifecycle' application and run
client commands


# max size error when deploying ruleapp or xom

Depending on the size of your XOM or the size of your Ruleapp, you may have the following error generated
by Fabric: 

"Error: error trying invoke chaincode. Error: Error: Received message larger than max (5868842 vs. 4194304)"

To workaround this error you need to perform the following actions:
- stop Fabric
- change the ~/.composer-connection-profiles/hlfv1/connection.json 
profile file store in your home directory to add the following 'maxRecvSize' and 'maxSendSize' properties:

{
    "type": "hlfv1",
    "orderers": [
       { "url" : "grpc://localhost:7050" }
    ],
    "ca": { "url": "http://localhost:7054", 
            "name": "ca.org1.example.com"
    },
    "peers": [
        {
            "requestURL": "grpc://localhost:7051",
            "eventURL": "grpc://localhost:7053"
        }
    ],
    "keyValStore": "/Users/johnsmith/.composer-credentials",
    "channel": "composerchannel",
    "mspID": "Org1MSP",
    "timeout": "300"
    "maxSendSize": "20971520",
    "maxRecvSize": "20971520",
}

This will allow messages of 20M instead of the default 4M. 

- restart Fabric after this change.
